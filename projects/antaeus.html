        <a>Theme and explanation</a>
        <p id="essay">While the short excerpt “Antaeus” has many themes, one stands out from the rest: Destruction is hugely easier than creation. Many examples reaffirm this valuable theme from within the narrative. One such illustration is that on page 183 when TJ and the gang are forced to destroy the garden that they spent so much time on, the narrator states: “It took less time than you would think; the task of destruction is infinitely easier than that of creation.” Another, again on page 183, says “...we scattered along the edge of earth, scooping it and throwing it over the parapet, destroying with anger the growth we had nurtured with such tender care.” Finally, on page 182, after the gang had finished growing the grass, they “couldn’t keep from looking at it, unable to believe that [they] had created this delicate growth.” It says that the growth was “delicate,” so, therefore, it was prolonged growth, and on the previous example, it also says that they were destroying “the growth that [they] had nurtured with such tender core,” so they had worked on that garden for a very long time and put much hard work into it. That contrasts with the work and time taken to destroy it, which brings one back to the undeniably true theme.</p>

        <a>Allusion to Antaeus</a>
        <p id="essay">One allusion in this story is that to Antaeus. The story’s title is “Antaeus,” but the actual words are only uttered a single time throughout the entire story: “[TJ] was a new Antaeus, preparing his own bed of strength.” Hence, this character of Antaeus must be significant. Antaeus was a Greek mythological giant, born of the god of the sea and Mother Earth. Whenever he was touching the ground, he couldn’t be beaten by any man, for he drew strength from the ground. But, eventually, Hercules found the secret and lifted the giant and killed him. These references allude to the mythological story of Antaeus in the title and the story, for TJ is very much like the giant. TJ draws strength from the ground and is broken when the adults force him to destroy the garden like Hercules destroyed Antaeus by destroying his connection to the Earth.

        <a>The garden's symbolization</a>
        <p id="essay">A symbol in the story is of the garden, which represents TJ’s strength. That statement is true because TJ draws strength from nature, and when he moves to NYC, the garden is his only connection that is left. However, when the adults force TJ to destroy it, he runs away, for his strength is gone, and he must get back to the South, where he had his farm. Also, the garden’s destruction represents the gang’s maturity, for they started with less maturity, but as the story progresses, they have more and can make a roof garden. When the story ends, and the garden is destroyed, their maturity progresses a significant amount.</p>

    <div id="character-page" class="box"><br><br><br><br>
        <a>TJ's character traits</a>
        <p id="essay">TJ is a leader. This is true because he pushes the group through the garden project, which never would have been able to get done otherwise, and, in the end, he is the first to start to destroy the roof garden. In the story, it says, “By the time we reached him, he had seized a board and thrust it into the soil, scooping it up and flinging it over the parapet into the areaway below.” This shows that he was the first to start destroying the garden, before any of the others, showing, indeed, that he is a leader.</p>
